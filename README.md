Abstract (still open to changes)
- A perceptron is perhaps one of the most time-consuming forms of neural networks. Its implementation is present in some U.S. government documents in the 1960s.
Its function is to divide two classes (or variables) according to a series of discriminants already defined. This separation is represented by a straight line. This method is useful to be able to place a population in a certain group of characteristics, as well as possible predictions (of basic character, of course).


Objectives:
  - Understand the perceptron algorithm.
  - Choose two variables in the Congressional Voting Records Data Set provided by the UCI machine learning repository using the  correlational coeficient to identify which variables would be useful.
  - Apply the perceptron algorithm in the data set mentioned before.
  
  
 Steps:
  - Understand the theory (Perceprton algorithm, correlation coeficient and machine learning concepts).
  - Understand the practical part (How is it apply).
  - Understand how is it apply in Python and start coding the algorithm.
 
 
 Motivation(s):
 - To understand the machine learning and neural network basics.
 - To apply the some probability topics seen in class. 
 - To learn how the databases can be applied for prediction algorithms.
