# Final project of Programming: Data 2A. Oswaldo Chan, Alan Peraza, Luis Zapata.

Abstract (still open to changes)
- A perceptron is perhaps one of the most time-consuming forms of neural networks. Its implementation is present in some U.S. government documents in the 1960s.
Its function is to divide two classes (or variables) according to a series of discriminants already defined. This separation is represented by a straight line. This method is useful to be able to place a population in a certain group of characteristics, as well as possible predictions (of basic character, of course).


Objectives:
  - Understand the perceptron algorithm.
  - Choose two variables in the Congressional Voting Records Data Set provided by the UCI machine learning repository using the  correlational coeficient to identify which variables would be useful.
  - Apply the perceptron algorithm in the data set mentioned before.
  
  
 Steps:
  - Understand the theory (Perceprton algorithm, correlation coeficient and machine learning concepts).
  - Understand the practical part (How is it apply).
  - Understand how is it apply in Python and start coding the algorithm.
 
 
 Motivation(s):
 - To understand the machine learning and neural network basics.
 - To apply the some probability topics seen in class. 
 - To learn how the databases can be applied for prediction algorithms.
  
Description:
Our case is about the 2016 congressional votes between Republicans and Democrats. The dataset consists of 16 variables, these being the issues that Republicans or Democrats accept/reject. The dataset comprises two possible outcomes:
in favor (represented by a "y"), and against (represented by an "n").
Here, we show the different aspects to consider:
1. Class Name: 2 (democrat, republican) <------ This is not considered as a variable per se.**
2. handicapped-infants: 2 (y,n) 
3. water-project-cost-sharing: 2 (y,n) 
4. adoption-of-the-budget-resolution: 2 (y,n) 
5. physician-fee-freeze: 2 (y,n) 
6. el-salvador-aid: 2 (y,n) 
7. religious-groups-in-schools: 2 (y,n) 
8. anti-satellite-test-ban: 2 (y,n) 
9. aid-to-nicaraguan-contras: 2 (y,n) 
10. mx-missile: 2 (y,n) 
11. immigration: 2 (y,n) 
12. synfuels-corporation-cutback: 2 (y,n) 
13. education-spending: 2 (y,n) 
14. superfund-right-to-sue: 2 (y,n) 
15. crime: 2 (y,n) 
16. duty-free-exports: 2 (y,n) 
17. export-administration-act-south-africa: 2 (y,n

The team will proceed to choose the two most important variables in order to carry out the project (as mentioned in the objectives).
