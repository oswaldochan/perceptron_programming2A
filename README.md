# Final project of Programming: Data 2A by oswo, alan and lichos

Goals:
  - Understand the perceptron algorithm
  - Choose two variables in the Congressional Voting Records Data Set provided by the UCI machine learning repository using the  correlational coeficient to identify which variables would be useful
  - Apply the perceptron algorithm in the data set mentioned before.
  
 Steps:
  - Understand the theory (Perceprton algorithm, correlation coeficient and machine learning concepts).
  - Understand the practical part (How is it apply).
  - Understand how is it apply in Python and start coding the algorithm.
